Random Notes
============

== Components / Commit Messages ==

As seen in commit messages, there's four broad classifications:

* GUI: generally anything you can actually see in the web browser.
* Build: build infrastructure etc.
* Doc: documentation, generally internal/developer (so far).
* Misc: anything else.  This includes changes to models where no
  GUI visible changes are made.

Within that, we generally narrow it down a bit, e.g.:

* GUI: explorer: (not "history", despite a handful of commit messages
  to the contrary)
* GUI: simulator: 
* GUI: wizard:
* GUI: summary_view:
* GUI: ui.location:
* etc.

This categorization is somewhat arbitrary, but tends to be either
functional area for larger changes or component/file name for
smaller changes.

=== New MVC (e.g.: for Constraints) ===

----------------------------------------
# script/generate controller Constraints
# vim app/models/constraint.rb
# vim test/unit/constraint_test.rb
