<h2>Colocation</h2>
<p>A colocational constraint tells the cluster which resources may or may
not run together on a node.</p>
<p>To create a location constraint, specify an ID, select the resources
between which to define the constraint, and add a score. The score
determines the location relationship between the resources.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Positive values: The resources should run on the same node. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Negative values: The resources should not run on the same node. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Score of INFINITY: The resources have to run on the same node. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Score of -INFINITY: The resources must not run on the same node.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An example for use of a colocation constraint is a Web service that
depends on an IP address. Configure individual resources for the IP
address and the Web service, then add a colocation constraint with a
score of INFINITY. It defines that the Web service must run on the
same node as the IP address. This also means that if the IP address is
not running on any node, the Web service will not be permitted to run.</p>
