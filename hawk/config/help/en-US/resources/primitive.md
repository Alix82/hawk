### Primitive

Primitive resources are the most basic type of resource.

To create a primitive, define an ID and specify some parameters like
class, (provider), and type.

An example of a primitive resource is `ocf:heartbeat:IPaddr`, which
can be used to configure a floating IP address for your cluster.
