For every service or application that you want to be highly available,
configure a cluster resource.  Cluster resources can include Web
sites, e-mail servers, databases, file systems, virtual machines, and
any other server-based applications or services.

Before configuring and starting a cluster resource, set up the service
or application first. For example, set up an Apache server and
complete its configuration before configuring a resource for it. If a
service or application has specific environment requirements, make
sure they are present and identical on all cluster nodes.
