<h2>Ticket</h2>
<p>Tickets are a special type of constraint used for Geo clustering. A
ticket grants the right to run certain resources on a specific cluster
site.</p>
<p>To create a ticket constraint, specify a constraint ID, enter a
ticket's ID and add the resources that you want to depend on this
ticket. Additionally, you can set a loss-policy to define what should
happen to the resources if the ticket is revoked. The attribute
<code>loss-policy</code> can have the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>fence</code>: Fence the nodes that are running the relevant resources.</li>
<li><code>stop</code>: Stop the relevant resources.</li>
<li><code>freeze</code>: Do nothing to the relevant resources.</li>
<li><code>demote</code>: Demote relevant resources that are running in master mode to slave mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>An example for a ticket constraint would be a primitive resource
<code>rsc1</code> that depends on <code>ticketA</code>. If you set <code>loss-policy="fence"</code>,
the node that runs <code>rsc1</code>  would be fenced in case <code>ticketA</code> is
revoked from the cluster site this node belongs to.</p>
