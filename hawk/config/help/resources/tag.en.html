<h2>Add a tag</h2>
<p>Tags are a way to refer to multiple resources at once, without
creating any colocation or ordering relationship between them. You can
use tags for grouping conceptually related resources. All resources
belonging to a tag can then be started or stopped with a single
command.</p>
<p>To create a tag, define an ID and select the objects that you want to
refer to with the tag.</p>
<p>For example, if you have several resources related to a database, you
can add all related resources to a tag named <code>database</code>.</p>
