* test simulator
* crazy escaping problems:
  * view recent events gives chunk of javascript (too escaped)
    * are there any other dialogs like this?
    * json delivering JS which gets escaped but shouldn't?
  * html entities in translated strings are double escaped (&copy; &gt; in sim)
* make sure gettext actually works
