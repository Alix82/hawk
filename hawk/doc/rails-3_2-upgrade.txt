* need to rework main layout based on new application layout (e.g.: csrf headers, includes etc.)
* management ops (start, stop etc.) give "unexpected server error 200" (?!?)
* test simulator
* crazy escaping problems:
  * view recent events gives chunk of javascript (too escaped)
    * are there any other dialogs like this?
    * json delivering JS which gets escaped but shouldn't?
  * html entities in translated strings are double escaped (&copy; &gt; in sim)
  * second page of wizard (use web server), input tag source appears in page
* can't create resources, templates, etc. (no route matches [PUT] "/cib/live/...")
* primtive list says "No primitive resources defined" even if primites exist (tag not hidden)
* make sure gettext actually works
